Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours.$Twenty minutes before you're ready to grill,soak wood chips (if using) in a bowl of water. (No grill? See broiler variation.)$Fold a 12-by-20-inch piece of heavy-duty foil in half to create a 12-by-10-inch double-thick piece. Transfer the wet wood chips to the center of the foil,allowing as much water as possible to drip back into the bowl. Create a packet by folding the short ends of the foil over the wood chips and sealing the open sides. Make 6 holes in the top of the foil packet with a skewer or the tip of a knife.$Place the packet of wood chips,pierced-side up,under the grill rack on top of the burners. Close the lid. Heat the grill to medium-high until the chips in the packet smell smoky and smoke begins to billow from under the lid,about 15 minutes. (Don't worry if the packet temporarily catches on fire.) Grill the chicken,turning and basting with the reserved marinade occasionally (discard any unused marinade),until just cooked through,20 to 30 minutes total,depending on the size.#Sesame-Free$Nut-Free$Dairy-Free$Soy-Free$High-Protein$Egg-Free$Gluten-Free#177#7#5#22#8#180

Chocolate Rye Babka#milk$yeast$flour$egg$sugar$salt$butter$chocolate$cocoa powder$cinnamon$espresso$nuts$water#½ cup reduced-fat milk, lukewarm (100°-110°F)$2 teaspoons active dry yeast (from 2 packets)$1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour$¾ cup whole rye flour, preferably light rye$1 large egg, at room temperature$1 tablespoon granulated sugar$¾ teaspoon salt$4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick), at room temperature$4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)$¼ cup granulated sugar$½ cup chopped bittersweet chocolate, preferably at least 70% cacao$¼ cup cocoa powder$½ teaspoon ground cinnamon$½ teaspoon espresso powder or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract$¼ teaspoon salt$½ cup chopped toasted nuts, such as pecans or walnuts$2 tablespoons cocoa nibs (Optional)$2 tablespoons granulated sugar$2 tablespoons water#To prepare dough: Combine milk and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, stirring briefly to incorporate. Let stand for about 5 minutes. Add all-purpose flour, rye flour, egg, 1 tablespoon sugar and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mix on low speed until the dough comes together off the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. Add softened butter and continue to mix until a soft, smooth, elastic dough forms and you can hear it slapping on the sides of the bowl, 8 to 10 minutes.$Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest at room temperature until puffy and roughly doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. (Alternatively, you can refrigerate the dough for 12 hours until you're ready to shape and bake your babka. This adds flexibility and also makes it easier to roll out the dough and spread the filling onto it when the time comes.)$To prepare filling: About 15 minutes before you're ready to shape your babka, heat butter and 1/4 cup sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat just until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved a bit, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add chocolate. Let the warmth of the butter and sugar melt the chocolate for a minute or so, then stir until smooth yet still gritty. Stir in cocoa, cinnamon, espresso powder (or vanilla) and salt. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes.$To prepare babka: Lightly coat a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.$Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-by-15-inch rectangle. Spread the cooled filling evenly over the dough to the edges. Sprinkle with nuts and cacao nibs, if using. Starting from one long side, roll the dough up into a tight log. If it's stretched longer than 15 inches, squish it back with your hands.$Using a sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise. With the cut sides facing up, twist the two halves together like a rope. Lift the twisted dough and scrunch it up so that you can fit it into the prepared pan. Cover and let the babka rise until it has just crested over the edge of the pan, 45 to 90 minutes.$Preheat oven to 350°F.$Bake the babka until the top is a deep golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers 190°F, about 40 minutes.$Meanwhile, prepare glaze: Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.$Brush or spoon the glaze on the top of the babka immediately when it comes out of the oven. Allow the babka to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes, before cutting.#Vegetarian#349#19#38#6#10#250

Add onions, hoisin sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, honey, ginger, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt; stir well to combine. Cover and refrigerate.$To prepare dough, combine 1 cup warm water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.$Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Add flour, oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt to yeast mixture; stir until a soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes). Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85°F), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in size. (Gently press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, dough has risen enough.)$Punch dough down; let rest 5 minutes. Turn dough out onto a clean surface; knead in baking powder. Let dough rest 5 minutes.$Divide dough into 10 equal portions, forming each into a ball. Working with one dough ball at a time (cover remaining dough balls to keep from drying), roll ball into a 5-inch circle. Place 1/4 cup filling in center of dough circle. Bring up sides to cover filling and meet on top. Pinch and seal closed with a twist. Repeat procedure with remaining dough balls and filling.$Arrange 5 buns seam side down, 1 inch apart, in each tier of a 2-tiered bamboo steamer.

Add warm water and shortening and mix with the dough hook for 10 minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.$Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Preheat oven to 425°F.$Spread cabbage, bok choy, onion, scallions, chiles to taste, garlic and ginger in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon peanut oil over the vegetables and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until cooked down and lightly browned, about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Transfer to a large bowl. Add basil, sesame oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar. Refrigerate until ready to form buns.$When the dough has risen, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, dusting with flour if sticky. Divide the dough into 10 balls. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.$To form each dumpling, flatten each ball into a 4-inch circle and fill with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the filling. Pinch the edges together to seal and twist (it will seem like too much filling but the dough is stretchy enough to hold it). Place the buns on a baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean towel and let rest for 30 minutes.$Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons peanut oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. When the oil is shimmery, add the buns, seam-side down. Cook until golden on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and add about 1 cup water to the pan (carefully because it will get a little spitty). Cover immediately and let the buns steam until puffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove cover and continue to cook until the water is gone, 3 to 5 minutes, lifting the buns to be sure the bottoms don't burn. Serve with soy sauce and black vinegar.#Dairy-Free$Vegan$Vegetarian$Egg-Free#196#8#28#3#10#120
