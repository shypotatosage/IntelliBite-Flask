See broiler variation.)$Fold a 12-by-20-inch piece of heavy-duty foil in half to create a 12-by-10-inch double-thick piece. Transfer the wet wood chips to the center of the foil,allowing as much water as possible to drip back into the bowl. Create a packet by folding the short ends of the foil over the wood chips and sealing the open sides. Make 6 holes in the top of the foil packet with a skewer or the tip of a knife.$Place the packet of wood chips,pierced-side up,under the grill rack on top of the burners. Close the lid.

Grill the chicken,turning and basting with the reserved marinade occasionally (discard any unused marinade),until just cooked through,20 to 30 minutes total,depending on the size.#Sesame-Free$Nut-Free$Dairy-Free$Soy-Free$High-Protein$Egg-Free$Gluten-Free#177#7#5#22#8#180
