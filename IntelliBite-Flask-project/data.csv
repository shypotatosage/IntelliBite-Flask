Jerk Chicken#scallions$onion$peppers$lime$olive$sugar$berries$cinnamon$nutmeg$salt$thyme leaves$chicken$wood chips#1 bunch scallions, chopped$1 small white onion$1-2 Scotch bonnet chile peppers, stemmed and quartered (see Tip)$1/4 cup lime juice$1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil$1 tablespoon light brown sugar$1 tablespoon whole allspice berries$1 teaspoon ground cinnamon$1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg$1 teaspoon salt$1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves$4 (6-ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed, trimmed$2 (12-ounce) bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed, trimmed and cut in half crosswise$1 cup wood chips, such as apple or hickory, for smoking (optional)#To prepare jerk marinade: Place scallions, onion, chile to taste, lime juice, oil, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and thyme in a blender. Process until smooth. Place chicken thighs and breasts in a nonreactive baking dish (see Tip). Rub 2/3 cup of the marinade onto both sides of the chicken. Transfer the remaining marinade to a small bowl; cover and refrigerate. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours.$Twenty minutes before you're ready to grill, soak wood chips (if using) in a bowl of water. (No grill? See broiler variation.)$Fold a 12-by-20-inch piece of heavy-duty foil in half to create a 12-by-10-inch double-thick piece. Transfer the wet wood chips to the center of the foil, allowing as much water as possible to drip back into the bowl. Create a packet by folding the short ends of the foil over the wood chips and sealing the open sides. Make 6 holes in the top of the foil packet with a skewer or the tip of a knife.$Place the packet of wood chips, pierced-side up, under the grill rack on top of the burners. Close the lid. Heat the grill to medium-high until the chips in the packet smell smoky and smoke begins to billow from under the lid, about 15 minutes. (Don't worry if the packet temporarily catches on fire.) Grill the chicken, turning and basting with the reserved marinade occasionally (discard any unused marinade), until just cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes total, depending on the size.#Sesame-Free$Nut-Free$Dairy-Free$Soy-Free$High-Protein$Egg-Free$Gluten-Free#177#7#5#22#8#180
