Let stand for about 5 minutes. Add all-purpose flour,rye flour,egg,1 tablespoon sugar and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mix on low speed until the dough comes together off the sides of the bowl,about 2 minutes. Add softened butter and continue to mix until a soft,smooth,elastic dough forms and you can hear it slapping on the sides of the bowl,8 to 10 minutes.$Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest at room temperature until puffy and roughly doubled in size,1 to 2 hours. (Alternatively,you can refrigerate the dough for 12 hours until you're ready to shape and bake your babka. This adds flexibility and also makes it easier to roll out the dough and spread the filling onto it when the time comes.)$To prepare filling: About 15 minutes before you're ready to shape your babka,heat butter and 1/4 cup sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat just until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved a bit,about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add chocolate. Let the warmth of the butter and sugar melt the chocolate for a minute or so,then stir until smooth yet still gritty. Stir in cocoa,cinnamon,espresso powder (or vanilla) and salt. Set aside to cool to room temperature,about 10 minutes.$To prepare babka: Lightly coat a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.$Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-by-15-inch rectangle. Spread the cooled filling evenly over the dough to the edges. Sprinkle with nuts and cacao nibs,if using. Starting from one long side,roll the dough up into a tight log. If it's stretched longer than 15 inches,squish it back with your hands.$Using a sharp knife,cut the log in half lengthwise. With the cut sides facing up,twist the two halves together like a rope. Lift the twisted dough and scrunch it up so that you can fit it into the prepared pan. Cover and let the babka rise until it has just crested over the edge of the pan,45 to 90 minutes.$Preheat oven to 350°F.$Bake the babka until the top is a deep golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers 190°F,about 40 minutes.$Meanwhile,prepare glaze: Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook,stirring occasionally,until the sugar has dissolved,1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.$Brush or spoon the glaze on the top of the babka immediately when it comes out of the oven. Allow the babka to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes,then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely,about 45 minutes,before cutting.#Vegetarian#349#19#38#6#10#250

Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly translucent but not brown, about 2 minutes. Add ground beef; cook, breaking it apart with a spoon, until it's no longer raw-looking but not browned (you want it to still be juicy and undercooked), about 3 minutes. Add fresh tomato, rice, cilantro, dill, parsley, paprika, cumin, cardamom, 1½ teaspoons salt and pepper. Stir until well combined. Add water and increase heat to high. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Drizzle the mixture with 1 teaspoon lemon juice and set aside.$Trim the zucchini tops and cut them, if needed, to fit vertically in a large tall pot. Using a small sharp knife, cut a circle along the outer line of the seeds and scoop out the centers with a teaspoon, melon baller or the handle of a spoon. (You can do this in stages, starting shallow and then scooping deeper as you go). You'll want to leave a thin wall (about 1/4-inch thick) and about an inch of each zucchini bottom intact.$Fill each zucchini with some of the stuffing mixture (don't pack it tightly), leaving about 1/2-inch of the top free of stuffing so the rice has room to expand. (If you have any stuffing mixture left over, you can shape it into meatballs and cook them in the pot with the stuffed zucchini until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes, and serve them with the zucchini. Alternatively, freeze the extra stuffing airtight for up to 3 months.)$Gently place all the stuffed zucchini upright in a large pot. They can lean on each other, but don't pack them in too tight because of the expansion of the rice. Add broth to the pot. If the zucchini are not almost submerged, add enough water until just the very tops are sticking up (this prevents too much stuffing from floating out). Drizzle the tops of the stuffed zucchini with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil.$Bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook until the zucchini are soft and the rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Carefully transfer the stuffed zucchini to a platter with tongs; cover to keep warm. Reserve the cooking liquid.$Combine canned tomatoes and their juice, 2 cups of the zucchini cooking liquid and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan.

Refrigerate until firm and cold, at least 1 hour or overnight.$Meanwhile, place apricots in a small saucepan and add 1 cup water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the water has mostly evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes.$Transfer the apricots and any remaining liquid to the bowl of a food processor. Process into a relatively smooth paste (some smaller chunks are OK). Add preserves, ginger and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt. Process, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until evenly incorporated. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool to room temperature.$Place 1 dough disk on a lightly floured work surface. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour. Roll the dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and top with a piece of parchment. Repeat with the second disk. Place on top of the other piece of dough. If the dough seems too soft to work with, chill for 15 to 30 minutes.$Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.$Once the filling is cool, place 1 dough circle on a cutting board. Spread half of the filling (about 6 tablespoons) evenly over the surface of the dough up to the edges. Using a sharp knife, pizza cutter or pastry wheel, cut the dough into 16 triangular wedges. (It helps to first cut the dough into 4 equal quarters then cut 4 wedges from each quarter.) Starting with the long edge, roll the wedges up toward their pointy ends to make little crescents. Place the rugelach on the prepared pan, ½-inch apart. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.$Bake the rugelach until light golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
